# FRC - First Robotics Competition
Documentation of FRC at SSIS in collaboration with Team 426 [Zombie Apocalypse Counter Task Force](https://zactf426.com/) from the Bronx, NY. Made possible thanks to the great teamwork of [Evan Weinberg](https://evanweinberg.com/) and [Keith Violette](https://sites.google.com/view/keithviolettesprojects/home).

## Outlook

With some FRC materials available we plan to restart the program in 2023. First step would be to [design a gocart](https://github.com/kreier/gocart23) with students and the materials. After this gained expericence we could set to rebuild a competition robot for one of the older competitions, like 2018 or 2019. Since teams participated in these competitions, some reference designs are available. Other teams signaled their support:

- [Team 4253](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/4253) - TAS Taipei American School
- Team 4817 - Singapore International School (Sumedth and Adriana)
- Team 1678 - Citrus Circuits (maybe? they visited October 2022 and won the Game Design Challenge 2021)
- Team 426  - They are the first to support us

And we should reach out to Evan and Keith since they kickstarted the whole program in 2019!

## Hibernating 2020-2023

For the following seasons the FRC participation at SSIS is on hold:

- 2020-2021 [Infinite Recharge (2021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Recharge_(2021)) (Matt Fagen won the Woodie Flowers Award)
- 2021-2022 [Rapid React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_React)
- 2022-2023 [Charged Up]()

In the spare time in 2023 it might be possible that the software of the rover is updated to recieve PWM control inputs without a Server Host, so that it could be controlled directly by an inexpensive 6-channel Radio Control Unit like FlySky FS-i6X or [MicroZone MC6C](https://www.lazada.vn/products/tang-kem-day-deo-tx-bo-dieu-khien-6-kenh-microzone-mc6c-tx-rx-nang-cap-i1495372640-s6257032973.html?). All the while Team 426 [scored 27/41](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2022/NYLI2/rankings) in the Long Island Competition 2022 "Rapid React".

## Season 2019-2020 Infinite Recharge

In 2019 [five Schools formed Team 426](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2020/team/426). They are:

- Pinkerton Academy
- Timberlane Regional High School
- School for Excellence
- Bronx International High School 
- Saigon South International School

The startkit was ordered in 2019 and build early 2020. Then the collaborative programming phase began. It mainly focused on the file `Team426Robot/scr/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java`. Some [34 commits](https://github.com/emwdx/Team426Robot/commits/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) can be seen from February 29, 2020 to March 12, 2020. The full repository is https://github.com/emwdx/Team426Robot .
